The object file will read line by line.  “H” is the header of record, ‘”T” is the text record, and “E” is the end record.  After reading the end of file, two files will close. 		+ For the header record, the address is where we start and convert to an integer, which will help to calculate the address.  Then print the header name. 		+ For text record, getting the start address of the text. If the address didn’t match with the current address, it will be label as RESW until they match.		+ For the opcode, the program will remove two right most bits.		+ For the end record, if the program address is greaterLesson learned:- Improving in C++ program language- Maintaining how to organize and practice doing on challenging project- Understanding format 2,3,4, and address modes.- Recognizing and processing assembler directives.
